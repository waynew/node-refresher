# On This File

Just a list of notes on things that I'm learning while I'm learning them, more
or less.

# Quickstart

The node:http quickstart docs were relatively straightforward, and after I
played around I realize that it was telling me most of what I had already
learned by introspection/playing around.

===================

es6 and beyond has some interesting bits,`--v8-options` piped into `less` sure
has a lot of information. `maglev` is an interesting moniker, probably is
something that goes fast man? There's some allocation flags that look like they
might be interesting. Also some heap & trace flags.
